INTERFACE
 it is defined as the place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act on or communicate with each other
 the man-machine interface. b : the means by which interaction or communication is achieved at an interface.

 example of interface
  virtual reality, ATMs, speedometer,the old iPod click wheel

 why interface ?
 It is used to achieve total abstraction. 
 Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, 
 by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances. It is also used to achieve loose coupling


Note 
Loose Coupling
 Loose coupling is an approach to interconnecting the components in a system or network 
 so that those components, also called elements, depend on each other to the least extent practicable. 
 Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another

In OOP
 Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement
 Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface,
 It is referred to as "polymorphism"

In contex of TYPESCRIPT

 In TypeScript, an interface is an abstract type that tells the compiler which property names a given object can have.
 TypeScript creates implicit interfaces when you define an object with properties. 
 It starts by looking at the object's property name and data type using TypeScript's type inference abilities.
