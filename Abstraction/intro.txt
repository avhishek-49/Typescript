Abstraction means hiding lower-level details and exposing only the essential and relevant details to the users



The concept behind abstraction is that we are hiding the complexity of the implementation from inherited classes and
we allow them to implement the functionality themselves.


In TypeScript, abstraction can be achieved by using the abstract keyword - which can be applied to both classes and methods
 specified in classes.
